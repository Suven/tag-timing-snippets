# Timing Snippets

The W3C Navigation, Resource, Paint and other timing APIs help us to measure when milestones occur as visitors browse our sites.


Third-Party tags have a crucial effect on our visitors experience and 

- When did our reviews service display the rating and reviews for a product?
- When did the anti-flicker snippet that our A/B testing tool recommends reveal the page?
- When did our IAB Consent Management Platform tell our advertising provider they could requests ads?
- When did adverts get displayed?
